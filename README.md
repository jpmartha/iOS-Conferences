# iOS Conferences in 2017

After I published [information about iOS conferences on Medium](https://medium.com/swift-column/ios-conferences-in-2017-swiftlang-iosdev-3ef75688c588#.ep89wg8mj) using [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jpmartha/fbc43745677bc9bf6486d4074c2c01d5), I received many requests for adding more conferences from around the world. But nobody can edit it except me on Gist, so I moved it here!

Please feel free to submit pull requests!!

# Work In Progress

I’m thinking of adding each local event held around the conference.
